Dear Group members

Welcome to our AES project.

Please install Visual studio 2012 first.

Then install the GIT tools from GitHub.com for your respective systemanout (42 MB).

You will then need to clone this project to your computers. I personally think it would be more 

maintainable if you push to your own fork of the project. Let's discuss on that further.

After you complete your assigned functions (see below), you will need to push your changes.

I have written a couple of tests to start us with. You will need to make sure your respective functions
pass the test written for it before you push your changes. If the test has a problem you are welcome to fix it along with
an explanation to help other group member to understand why you made the changes.

Assignments

Ashenafi - SubBytes (with inverse)

Bethel   - ShiftRows (with inverse)

Lydia    - MixColumns (with inverse)

Tinbit   - AddRoundKey (Includes Key Expansion). Since you have no inverse, please implement the main function :)

Note: I haven't written all required tests- just some to start us with. Don't be shy to write your own and get own
with it. Just be sure to committ your changes as often as possible. No tests are written for the inverse transformations for instance.

Don't be limited by how I structured the functions. Specifically, its recommended that the function parameteres 
be flexible against key and round size changes. Think how this feature can be organized and whether the current setup
can accomdate the recommended flexibility.

Wish us all the best!
